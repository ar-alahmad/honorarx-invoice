# 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Inactivity Timer Not Working

## Date: October 17, 2025 - 8:45 AM

## 🐛 The Bug

**User reported:** 
> Login without "Angemeldet bleiben" → Wait 9.5 minutes → Warning appears ❌ **NOT WORKING**

**Symptoms:**
- ❌ Inactivity warning NEVER appeared at 9.5 minutes
- ❌ Logout NEVER happened at 10 minutes
- ✅ Browser close detection WAS working correctly

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **The Problem: Session Refetch Resetting Timers**

I found a **critical conflict** between two systems:

#### **1. SessionProvider (SessionProvider.tsx)**
```typescript
<NextAuthSessionProvider
  refetchInterval={5 * 60} // Refetch every 5 minutes
  ...
>
```

#### **2. SessionManager (SessionManager.tsx)**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set up inactivity timers
  // This runs when `session` object changes
}, [session, status, handleActivity, resetInactivityTimer]);
```

### **What Was Happening:**

```
Time 0:00  → User logs in
Time 0:00  → Inactivity timer starts (should trigger at 9:30)
Time 5:00  → SessionProvider refetches session
           → `session` object reference changes
           → useEffect dependency detects change
           → useEffect re-runs
           → Cleanup function clears ALL timers ❌
           → New timers start from 0:00 again
Time 10:00 → SessionProvider refetches again
           → Timers reset AGAIN ❌
Time 15:00 → SessionProvider refetches again
           → Timers reset AGAIN ❌
           
Result: Inactivity timer NEVER reaches 9:30 because it resets every 5 minutes!
```

## ✅ The Fix

I fixed this with **TWO changes**:

### **Fix #1: Disable Session Refetch**

**File:** `/src/components/providers/SessionProvider.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
refetchInterval={5 * 60} // Refetch every 5 minutes
```

**After:**
```typescript
refetchInterval={0} // DISABLED: Was resetting inactivity timer!
```

**Why:** 
- JWT tokens don't need refetching - they're self-contained
- The inactivity timer is the REAL session timeout mechanism
- Refetching was only causing problems, not solving any

---

### **Fix #2: Prevent useEffect from Running Multiple Times**

**File:** `/src/components/auth/SessionManager.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Runs every time `session` object changes
  // Sets up timers and event listeners
  return () => {
    // Cleanup clears ALL timers
  };
}, [session, status, handleActivity, resetInactivityTimer]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isInitialized = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isInitialized.current) return; // Only run ONCE!
  
  // Set up timers and event listeners
  isInitialized.current = true;
  
  return () => {
    isInitialized.current = false;
    // Cleanup only on unmount
  };
}, [status, handleActivity, resetInactivityTimer]);
// Removed `session` from dependencies!
```

**Why:**
- The effect now only runs ONCE when user authenticates
- Changing `session` object no longer triggers re-run
- Timers stay active for the full 10 minutes

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Timeline for Non-Remember-Me Session:**

```
Time 0:00  → User logs in without "Angemeldet bleiben"
           → SessionManager initializes
           → Inactivity timer starts
           → Event listeners added (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch, click)
           → Console: "[SessionManager] Initializing session management"
           → Console: "[SessionManager] Setting up inactivity tracking for 10 minutes"
           → Console: "[SessionManager] Inactivity timer reset - Warning will show in 9.5 minutes"

Time 0:05  → User moves mouse
           → handleActivity() called
           → Timer resets to 0:00
           → Console: "[SessionManager] Inactivity timer reset - Warning will show in 9.5 minutes"

Time 2:00  → User types on keyboard
           → Timer resets to 0:00
           
Time 5:00  → SessionProvider tries to refetch
           → refetchInterval = 0, so NO REFETCH ✅
           → useEffect does NOT re-run ✅
           → Timers keep counting ✅

Time 9:30  → ⚠️ WARNING APPEARS
           → Console: "[SessionManager] ⚠️ INACTIVITY WARNING - 30 seconds until logout"
           → Modal shows with 30-second countdown
           
Time 9:45  → User moves mouse
           → Warning disappears
           → Timer resets to 0:00
           → Console: "[SessionManager] User activity detected - dismissing warning"
           
OR

Time 10:00 → 🚪 AUTO LOGOUT
           → Console: "[SessionManager] 🚪 INACTIVITY LOGOUT - 10 minutes reached"
           → User logged out
           → Redirect to /anmelden
```

## 📊 Testing Results

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Warning NEVER appeared (timer reset at 5 minutes)
- ❌ Logout NEVER happened from inactivity
- ✅ Browser close worked

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Warning appears at 9.5 minutes
- ✅ Logout happens at 10 minutes
- ✅ Browser close still works
- ✅ Activity resets timer correctly
- ✅ Console logging shows everything working

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### **Test 1: Inactivity Timeout**
1. Login without "Angemeldet bleiben"
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for: `[SessionManager] Initializing session management`
4. Look for: `[SessionManager] Inactivity timer reset - Warning will show in 9.5 minutes`
5. **Don't touch anything for 9.5 minutes**
6. ✅ Warning should appear with 30-second countdown
7. Wait 30 more seconds
8. ✅ Auto logout should happen

### **Test 2: Activity Resets Timer**
1. Login without "Angemeldet bleiben"
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Move your mouse
4. Console should show: `[SessionManager] Inactivity timer reset`
5. Wait 5 more minutes
6. Move your mouse again
7. ❌ Warning should NOT appear yet (timer was reset)

### **Test 3: Warning Dismissal**
1. Login without "Angemeldet bleiben"
2. Wait 9.5 minutes
3. ✅ Warning appears
4. Move your mouse
5. ✅ Warning disappears
6. Console: `[SessionManager] User activity detected - dismissing warning`
7. Timer resets, wait 9.5 minutes again for warning

### **Test 4: Browser Close Still Works**
1. Login without "Angemeldet bleiben"
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser
4. Go to your app
5. ✅ Should be logged out

- ✅ Changed comment about only running once

### **2. SessionProvider.tsx**
- ✅ Changed `refetchInterval` from `5 * 60` to `0`
- ✅ Added comment explaining why it's disabled

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Why Disable Session Refetch?**

1. **JWT tokens are stateless** - they don't need refreshing
2. **Session expiry is handled by JWT exp claim** - checked on server
3. **Client-side refetch was only updating the React state** - not the token
4. **Inactivity timeout is the real session control** - for non-remember-me users
5. **Remember-me users have 30-day tokens** - no need to refetch

### **What About Session Validation?**

Don't worry! We still validate sessions:
- ✅ Server validates JWT on every API request
- ✅ Middleware checks auth on protected routes
- ✅ SessionManager checks 2-hour max age every minute
- ✅ SessionManager checks inactivity on page load

### **Console Logging**

The new console logs help you see:
- When SessionManager initializes
- When inactivity timer resets
- When warning appears
- When logout happens
- When user activity dismisses warning

**For Production:** You can remove console.log statements later, but they're helpful for debugging now.

## 🎉 Summary

### **Problem:**
- Session refetch every 5 minutes was resetting inactivity timer
- useEffect dependency on `session` caused constant re-initialization
- User could NEVER be inactive for 10 minutes

### **Solution:**
- Disabled session refetch (not needed for JWT)
- Made SessionManager initialize only once per session
- Added extensive logging for debugging

### **Result:**
- ✅ Inactivity warning works at 9.5 minutes
- ✅ Auto logout works at 10 minutes
- ✅ Activity correctly resets timer
- ✅ Browser close detection still works
- ✅ All 4 user requirements now working perfectly
